Prototyping ETA: June 30th.

=================================================

To the reader,

This is not yet a functional program. It is still in initial development.
I hope to have a working prototype by June 30th however that is subject
  to minor or drastic change.

Please feel free to add pull requests for changes to my code. If something
  is badly coded or unoptomized please let me know, but also provide a why
  and a method to fix the problem.

This is my first major project which has gone through months of vigerous
  planning and organizing. I am new to github, so please go easy on me
  with respect to major project structure and github structure.

Thanks,
Shawn Clake

Unprecedented is best explained by seeing it in action. If I feel interested
  at some point, I will try and detail a description of what unprecedented is.
